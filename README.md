### Smart HPA - Smart Horizontal Pod Auto-scaler

This repository contains the codebase and implementation details of hierarchical architecture and resource-efficient heuristics of Smart HPA, which allows the exchange of resources among microservices, facilitating effective auto-scaling of microservices in resource-constrained environments.  

### Table of Contents

The package contains the following directories.

#### 1. Benchmark Application
This folder includes the source and deployment files for the microservice benchmark application and the load test script. Further details regarding the benchmark application can be found at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.

#### 2. SmartHPA Codebase
This folder contains the scripts for Microservice Managers dedicated to each microservice within the benchmark application. The scripts for the Adaptive Resource Manager and Microservice Capacity Analyzer components are also included as part of codebase.

#### 3. Results Analysis Script
The script used to determine and analyze the evaluation metrics from the recorded data to assess the performance of Smart HPA is in this folder. 

#### 4. Results Visualization Script
The script in this folder is used for data visualization and generating the bar and line graphs presented in the paper.
